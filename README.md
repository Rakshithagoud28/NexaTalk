# NexaTalk: Next-Gen Talking Assistant

## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, users want hands-free, intelligent assistance that can understand and respond to voice queries instantly. Existing assistants like Alexa and Siri are closed ecosystems, limiting integration with custom data or advanced reasoning models.  

There is a need for an open, customizable AI voice assistant that:

- Accurately understands spoken queries in real time.
- Retrieves relevant data from custom knowledge sources.
- Generates human-like, context-aware responses.
- Speaks responses back to the user naturally.

---

## Proposed Solution
**NexaTalk** is a voice-driven AI assistant that:

1. Listens to user queries via microphone.
2. Transcribes speech to text using **Whisper Small**.
3. Enhances queries with **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to include relevant context from your dataset.
4. Generates intelligent responses via **Groq LLM** or **Gemini AI**.
5. Speaks the answer back using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.
6. Handles both general and custom domain-specific queries.
